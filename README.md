Frontend
The add category feature is in the settings sub menu in sidebar where we will be adding the category here the add Category API 
will be hitting
along with that we have an delete feature where we are performing the soft delete in which the data we are not removing 
from the database
Once the category is added then we have to consider an home page where we are adding the expense in which we are including 
the particular category
We have an option of updating every field along with that we are able to delete the expense where delete is the soft delete 
that we are performing over here
Finally the sum of expense is calculated and will be displayed
